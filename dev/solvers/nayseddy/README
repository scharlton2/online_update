"NaysEddy" is a three-dimensional solver for calculation of unsteady flows using Cartesian coordinates. It solved the complex geometries in a rubost way by using ghost-cell immersed boundary techniques. The solver is based on full Navier-Stokes equations and apply large-eddy simulation (LES) as turbulemce closure. This solver was initially developed by Mohamed Nabi of Hokkaido University in 2007 (At that time, he was a PhD candidate in Delft University, the Netherlands).
Since NaysEddy is a fully three-dimensional large-eddy simulation model, it generally requires more CPU time than two-dimensional models and models based on RANS. Although this engine is basically not suitable for computations of large reach of rivers, it will become a powerful tool to analyze detailed structures of flows with local or segment scales in rivers.
